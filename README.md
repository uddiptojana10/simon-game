What is a Simon game?
It is an exciting game of lights and sounds in which players must repeat random sequences of flashing lights by pressing the colored pads in the correct order.
How to play:
1. Game starts when you press any key.
2. The game starts with the device lighting up and producing a sound. Remember the sequence of the colors and sounds, as you will need to repeat it in the next step.
3. Click on the buttons in the same order as the sequence that you saw and heard. If you get the sequence right, the game will progress to the next round, which will have an additional step.
4. If you make a mistake get the sequence wrong, the game will end displaying your score and you will need to start over.

What are you waiting for? My highest score was 34. Can you beat it?
